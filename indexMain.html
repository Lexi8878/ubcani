							<h2>Pop-Up Hanami!</h2>
							<p>It’s time to finally unveil our biggest event<br>
							of the year: Pop-Up Hanami! Inspired by the sakura <br>
							trees scattered around UBC Campus and the Japanese<br>
							tradition of Hanami (花見) or “Flower Viewing”, UBCAni<br>
							will be pulling out all the stops this year to create the<br>
							largest and most complete event in our clubs history!</p>
							
							<p> The event will include:
							<ul>
								<li>A Sakura Cosplay Cafe, where Servers in full<br>
								cosplay will be bringing you some of the best pastries<br>
								and desserts Vancouver has to offer (at a reasonable price),<br>
								and handmade anime-inspired drinks. </li>
								<li>An Artist Alley, where you can purchase exclusive<br>
								and never-before-seen art made by our club’s most talented<br>
								artists, and other vendors including some of our amazing sponsors!</li>
								<li>Performances including idol groups, DJ sets, and non-stop<br>
								J-pop, J-rock, and anime music for the entire event!</li>
								<li>And tons of games (including a Pop-Up Hanami scavenger hunt)<br>
								where you can earn tickets to increase your chances of winning<br>
								one of our many prizes!</li>
